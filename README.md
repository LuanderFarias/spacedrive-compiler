# Project canceled.
I realized that a compiler for spacedrive is not needed. Yeah, some people don't know (or have problems) compiling spacedrive. But my program would not solve it. If the user commands would not work using the normal compile method, the compiler is not going to work too. There's not a way to prevent the compilation to fail cause every user has it's different setup. Something much more efective would be compiling spacedrive by myself and letting the .exe or .deb public. In a system like nightly-releases. So... yeah, spacedrive-compiler is not a thing anymore. actually never was cause i never finished it. Sorry for all the people that liked the project and was waiting for it. Let's wait till the incredible team of spacedrive do what they have to do. And pls do not don't rush them.

# What is spacedrive?
Spacedrive is an open source cross-platform file manager, powered by a virtual distributed filesystem (<a href="#what-is-a-vdfs">VDFS</a>) written in Rust.

> NOTE: Spacedrive is under active development, most of the listed features are still experimental and subject to change.

Organize files across many devices in one place. From cloud services to offline hard drives, Spacedrive combines the storage capacity and processing power of your devices into one personal distributed cloud, that is both secure and intuitive to use.

For independent creatives, hoarders and those that want to own their digital footprint, Spacedrive provides a free file management experience like no other.

# Why i'm doing a compiler?

Compiling spacedrive is not that hard, you only need some basic/intermediate technical aknowledge. but it takes a lot of time and everything is done using the system terminal (and i love it). I would like to enter in a program and just select how i want to build spacedrive and boom! perfectly compiled

I don't know if jamie or anyone of the spacedrive dev team is gonna make a compiler (probably no, cause nobody cares) so i made this for me and everyone that wants a easy way to compile and finally test spacedrive. This repository and the program probably gonna be uncontinued and archived in the future. Cause when a official public version of spacedrive release, this program gonna be obsolet.

# License
As spacedrive this repository uses AGPL-3.0 license. which is probably not the smartest option for a simple project like this but ok...
